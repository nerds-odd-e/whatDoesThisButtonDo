# OpenAI Integration

User will need to provide an OpenAI API key in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

WhatDoesThisButtonDo will use OpenAI chat completion API, send all the test oracle to it as assistant messages, and let the assistant generate a list of test cases.

For now, the framework just prints the test cases to the console.
