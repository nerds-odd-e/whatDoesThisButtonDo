# Introduction to WhatDoesThisButtonDo

"WhatDoesThisButtonDo" is a general purpose automated exploratory testing tool using AI assistant.


**1\. Project Goals and Vision**


• This is an open-source project to create a **general-purpose exploratory testing tool augmented by an AI assistant**.

• The primary goals of the tool are:

1\. **Identifying Missing Requirements:** Using exploratory testing to uncover gaps in the application based on provided requirements or test oracles.

2\. **Bug Identification:** Helping users find defects or issues during the testing process.

3\. **Regression Test Discovery:** Identifying test paths that should be repeated later to ensure the stability of the application.

4\. **Efficient Testing:** Supporting a **breadth-first approach** to exploratory testing, prioritizing areas based on time and relevance.

**2\. User Persona**


• The tool targets developers like **Alex**, a persona defined during the discussion:

• Alex is a **software developer with traditional development experience**, particularly in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

• Alex’s old workflow involves breaking requirements into smaller goals, writing tests to see them fail, implementing simple solutions to pass the tests, and then refactoring the code.

<p><br></p>

**3\. Tool Features and Workflow**


• **Tool Workflow:**

1\. **Initialization:** Alex writes a start() function to initialize the application and capture its state.

2\. **State Analysis:** The AI assistant collects the application’s current state and compares it with requirements or expected functionality.

3\. **Exploratory Testing:** The AI performs actions like clicking buttons, entering inputs, or navigating paths to explore the application.

4\. **Feedback Loop:** The AI flags discrepancies, proposes new regression tests, or highlights missing functionalities.

• **Testability Tools:**

• Alex must provide tools (e.g., assertions, data builders) to help the AI perform meaningful actions and verify application states.

• **Regression Testing:**

• The tool suggests converting AI findings (e.g., bugs or successful paths) into structured regression tests that can be reused in a CI/CD pipeline.

<p><br></p>

**4\. Critical Considerations**

<p><br></p>

• **Test Environment Setup:**

• Each test must start from a clean and isolated environment, such as using a **sandbox** or resetting the application state.

• The tool should support flexible testability, allowing Alex to test at unit, backend, or full-product levels.

• **Human-AI Collaboration:**

• While the AI explores and suggests improvements, Alex provides judgment on whether flagged issues are genuine bugs or require further action.

• **Output and Reporting:**

• The tool aims for **minimal but actionable output**, focusing on:

1\. Missing requirements (e.g., suggestions for new functionalities).

2\. Bug reports (detailed issues with reproduction steps).

3\. Regression test suggestions (new or updated tests for ongoing stability).

4\. Suspicious behaviors (patterns or anomalies requiring investigation).

• **Balancing Automation and Human Judgment:**

• The tool leverages AI to suggest paths or identify issues but relies on Alex to confirm whether to act on the AI’s findings.

**5\. Challenges and Open Questions**

<p><br></p>

• **Requirement Ambiguity:**

• How will the AI handle unclear or incomplete requirements provided by users?

• **Exploratory Depth:**

• How to ensure the AI explores meaningfully instead of taking random actions?

• **Output Precision:**

• How to balance concise reporting with the need for comprehensive debugging details?

• **Regression Test Automation:**

• Automating the transition from AI-identified issues to reusable regression tests.

<p><br></p>

**6\. Broader Implications**

<p><br></p>

• **Iterative Development Approach:**

• The tool should evolve iteratively, incorporating user feedback to refine its capabilities and expand its scope.

• **Integration with Development Practices:**

• The tool will be designed to integrate seamlessly into workflows (e.g., CI/CD pipelines), supporting various development needs.

• **Enhancing Developer Productivity:**

• By automating parts of exploratory testing, the tool allows developers to focus on fixing issues and improving the application.
